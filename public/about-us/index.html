<p>
We are a friendly, energetic and enthusiastic group who enjoy dancing
together and taking our dances to a variety of audiences. In summer we
perform in and around Windsor and further afield, at festivals, and as
guests of other Morris sides.
</p>
<p>
Like any street entertainment, we hope you will enjoy our performance
and tokens of appreciation from you in the form of coins (or bank
notes!) are welcome and, yes, we take contactless!
</p>
<p>
As our name suggests, we are based in <em>Windsor</em>, in Berkshire,
one of the ‘Home Counties’ to the west of London, England. The town is
dominated by the magnificent castle, one of the King’s main residences,
which is portrayed in our logo.
</p>
<p>
Windsor Morris was founded in 1974, which makes us one of the
longest-established women’s morris teams in the country. In September
2011, Shirley Dixon, our foreman (instructor) at the time, wrote a brief
history of Windsor Morris <a href="/doc/EFDSSarticle.pdf">[PDF]</a>
where you can read about the “interesting times” in the 1970s when it
was revolutionary for women to dance the Morris<a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="footnote-ref-1">1</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
Our dances are based on the styles performed at the end of the
nineteenth century in the Cotswold villages of <a href="http://badby.org.uk/">Badby</a> and <a href="http://www.brackleynorthants-tc.gov.uk/">Brackley</a>. We perform
to the lively music of the melodeon, accompanied by an uplifting
drumbeat. We have adapted these styles to provide an exciting spectacle
and continue to compose new dances - like our predecessors, we are
keeping morris dancing alive by adapting it.
</p>
<p>
In 2005 we adopted a new ‘Tradition’ (style of dance steps and
figures), based on <em>Minneapolis-on-Charles</em>, a style developed by
<a href="http://www.commonwealthmorris.org/">The Commonwealth Morris
Men</a> in the USA. We first saw them dance it at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarlboroMorrisAle">Marlboro Morris
Ale</a> in 1983, and learned the details from <a href="http://www.timradford.com/tim.html">Tim Radford</a> at an Advanced
Morris Weekend some twenty years later! In homage to the original, we
call it <em>Windsor-on-Thames</em>.

We are easily spotted in our sparkling white kit, with splashes of
green, red and yellow on our rosettes and ribbons providing a colourful
contrast. Watch out for our ‘Fools’, who act as our MCs and can give us
a noisy whack with the bladder if we step out of line - Cherry, with the
Round Tower hat, and Sally, given to punning limericks.
</p>
<p>
We are often asked how we keep our kit sparkling white. Quite easy
really - we avoid messy food, children and dogs, and don’t sit down all
day!
</p>
<p>
We get together every week, on a Wednesday evening, to work on
perfecting our team-work, training up new dancers and musicians, and
inventing new dances. The dancers in the team are all female, since we
aim to have a consistent team style, but we do have male musicians. We
<a href="/course/">run a ‘taster’ course</a> every Autumn at which
<strong>you too</strong> can learn to dance.
</p>
<p>
Windsor Morris are members of the <a href="http://www.morrisfed.org.uk">Morris Federation</a>.
</p>
<p>
During the practice season (October through April) you can find us at
the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Gardeners+Hall/@51.470932,-0.620298,16z">Gardeners
Hall, St Leonards Rd, Windsor, SL4 3DR</a> every Wednesday night from
8pm.

<p>
That’s brilliant! Cotswold Morris is welcoming, inclusive, and a lot
of fun. You don’t need to be an expert dancer—just willing to learn. <a href="/course">We offer taster sessions</a> in the Autumn and will be
happy to teach you some steps, some dances, and something about the
traditions.
</p>
<p>
You’ll find that morris is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A great way to stay active
</li>
<li>
A warm, supportive community
</li>
<li>
Opportunities to perform at festivals and events
</li>
<li>
A chance to be part of something meaningful and joyful
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Everyone is welcome</strong> to join us at these taster
sessions.
