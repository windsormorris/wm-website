Cotswold Morris Dancing: Tradition, Community, and a Bit of Magic
</h2>
<p>
You’ve seen the bells, the sticks, the handkerchiefs—and maybe you’re
wondering what on earth is going on. Whether you’re curious, sceptical,
or thinking of joining in, Cotswold Morris dancing has something to say
to you.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="i-just-saw-you-in-town-what-is-that">
👀 <em>“I just saw you in
town — what is that?”</em>
</h3>
<p>
What you saw was <strong>Cotswold Morris dancing</strong>, a
traditional English folk dance that’s been around for centuries. It
comes from the villages of the Cotswold Hills, a region in south-central
England, and is usually performed by six dancers in white, with bells on
their legs and either <strong>handkerchiefs</strong> or
<strong>sticks</strong> in hand.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The dancers form patterns whilst performing quite complex steps:
lines moving forward and back, weaving in and out, dancing in circles.
We dance to live music from a <em>melodeon</em> (that’s a button
accordian / squeezebox) and <em>drum</em>, creating a rhythmic, joyful
spectacle.
</p>
<p>
Cotswold Morris is a <strong>living tradition</strong>, passed down
through generations. Although each particular village tradition had its
own steps, tunes, and style, each new generation, each new team, each
new dancer has their own interpretation. You can find more information
about the specific styles we dance <a href="/about-us">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>Day of Dance</strong> (which is perhaps what you saw) is
more than just entertainment — it’s a cultural event. It brings together
sides from across the region (and sometimes beyond) to share dances,
music, and camaraderie. It’s colourful, musical, and deeply rooted in
English folk heritage. It’s not just a performance; it’s a celebration
of community, tradition, and fun.

<em>“Hang on, isn’t Morris Dancing just for men - and old men in funny
hats at that?”</em>
</h3>
<p>
We hear you. That’s a common stereotype—but it’s not the full
picture.
</p>
<p>
Yes, Morris dancing has deep roots, and yes, some dancers have been
doing it for decades. But today’s Cotswold Morris scene is
<strong>diverse, dynamic, and evolving</strong>. You’ll find dancers of
all ages, genders, and backgrounds. Some sides are traditional, others
are experimental. Some perform in pubs, others at festivals or even
abroad.
</p>
<p>
People dance Morris because it’s <strong>fun</strong>, it’s
<strong>social</strong>, and it’s <strong>real</strong>. It’s not about
being trendy—it’s about doing something joyful, physical, and connected
to a shared cultural story.
</p>
<p>
Why do people care? Because it brings people together. Because it
makes people smile. And because it’s a blast to do.

💃🏻🕺🏽 <em>“I’m
thinking of joining — what should I know?”</em>
</h3>
<p>
That’s brilliant! Cotswold Morris is welcoming, inclusive, and a lot
of fun. You don’t need to be an expert dancer—just willing to learn. <a href="/course">We offer taster sessions</a> in the Autumn and will be
happy to teach you some steps, some dances, and something about the
traditions.
</p>
<p>
You’ll find that morris is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A great way to stay active
</li>
<li>
A warm, supportive community
</li>
<li>
Opportunities to perform at festivals and events
</li>
<li>
A chance to be part of something meaningful and joyful
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you enjoy music, movement, and a bit of tradition, you’ll fit
right in.

<h3 id="𓋹-is-it-all-pagan">
☽𓋹☾ Is it all pagan?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>No</strong>. You might hear of morris dancing being a
survival of pagan fertility rites, but this is just a romantic myth.
Some modern teams may call themselves ‘pagan’ however — perhaps because
they genuinely adopt a symbolic, nature-revering, and ritualistic
approach to their dance, or perhaps because it’s a great excuse to dress
up!
</p>
<h3 id="so-how-old-is-morris-dancing">
⌛ So, how old is Morris
Dancing?
</h3>
<p>
The earliest evidence of morris dancing dates from the 15th century,
when royal courts and wealthy households throughout Europe were paying
for ‘Morys’, ‘Morisk’, ‘Moresca’ or similarly named dancers – these were
highly-paid professionals providing high-status entertainment.
</p>
<p>
In 1600, Shakespearean actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kempe">Will Kemp</a> danced a
Morris Dance from London to Norwich in nine days, to raise money and as
a publicity stunt. We know this because he wrote a booklet about it,
which he called <em>Nine Daies Wonder</em>.
</p>
<p>
But what was called “Morris” from this time doesn’t really look like
what you might see today…
</p>
<p>
However, we do know that Morris dances <strong>of the sort you see
today</strong> were being performed in the nineteenth century (i.e.&nbsp;the
1800s).
</p>
<p>
We know this because the dances (and music) were written down in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries by collectors who had the time, money
and interest enough to travel througout England asking old people about
the music <em>and dance</em> of their youth (which would be the
mid-1800s). What these people described is by and large the basis of
what is danced today, though, of course, many of today’s dances are
modern evolutions.
</p>
<p>
Why did these collectors do this? Well, towards the end of the 19th
and the start of the 20th centuries, there was a big upsurge in interest
in national folk customs, including folk music. But what was this “music
from their own lands”? They had to go out and find it. We are grateful
to these collectors, as without them it is highly unlikely that we would
know much about these dance traditions at all - they were dying out and
might have disappeared without trace (as we know many, many Cotswold
village traditions did).
</p>
<h3 id="are-there-other-types-of-morris">
🤔 Are there other types of
Morris?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Yes</strong>. The term Morris Dancing covers a number of
forms including dances with clogs, bells, hankies, sticks, swords and
disguised faces. What links all these styles today is that the dances
are done for show. It brings people together; it makes people smile; and
it’s a blast to do!
