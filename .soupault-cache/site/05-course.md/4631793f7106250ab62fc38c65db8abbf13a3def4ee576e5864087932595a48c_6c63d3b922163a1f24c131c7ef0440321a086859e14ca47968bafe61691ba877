<p>We’re not all born Morris dancers! Few Morris dancers come from a
Morris dancing background; we tried it and loved it, and you can have a
go too.</p>

Every year in the autumn, we run three, free, weekly taster sessions
(every Wednesday evening) so you too can come along and find out what
it’s all about. <br/><small>© 2011 Lucy Goddard.</small></p>

The first session will be on <strong>Wednesday 10th September 2025 from
8pm</strong>. Do please come along, enjoy yourself and see what all the
fuss is about!
