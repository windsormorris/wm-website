<p>As our name suggests, we are based in <em>Windsor</em>, in Berkshire,
one of the ‘Home Counties’ to the west of London, England. The town is
dominated by the magnificent castle, one of the King’s main residences,
which is portrayed in our logo.</p>
<p>The side was founded in 1974, which makes us one of the
longest-established women’s morris teams in the country.</p>
<p>We are a friendly, energetic and enthusiastic group who enjoy dancing
together and taking our dances to a variety of audiences. We get
together every week, on a Wednesday evening, to work on perfecting our
team-work, training up new dancers and musicians, and inventing new
dances. The dancers in the team are all female, since we aim to have a
consistent team style, but we do have male musicians.</p>
<p>Our dances are based on the styles performed at the end of the
nineteenth century in the Cotswold villages of <a
href="http://badby.org.uk/" target="_blank">Badby</a> and <a
href="http://www.brackleynorthants-tc.gov.uk/"
target="_blank">Brackley</a>. We perform to the lively music of the
melodeon, accompanied by an uplifting drumbeat. We have adapted these
styles to provide an exciting spectacle and continue to compose new
dances. We dance in a lively and energetic manner (well, most of the
time!). We also like to create new dances - like our predecessors, we
are keeping morris dancing alive by adapting it.</p>
<p>In 2005 we adopted a new ‘Tradition’ (style of dance steps and
figures), based on <em>Minneapolis-on-Charles</em>, a style developed by
<a href="http://www.commonwealthmorris.org/" target="_blank">The
Commonwealth Morris Men</a> in the USA. We first saw them dance it at
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarlboroMorrisAle"
target="_blank">Marlboro Morris Ale</a> in 1983, and learned the details
from <a href="http://www.timradford.com/tim.html" target="_blank">Tim
Radford</a> at an Advanced Morris Weekend some twenty years later! In
homage to the original, we call it <em>Windsor-on-Thames</em>.</p>
<p>In September 2011, Shirley Dixon, our foreman (instructor) at the
time, wrote <a href="/doc/EFDSSarticle.pdf" target="_blank">a brief
history of Windsor Morris</a> where you can read about the “interesting
times” in the 1970s when it was revolutionary for women to dance the
Morris. This was originally published in <em>English Dance and
Song</em>, the members’ magazine of the <a
href="http://www.efdss.org/support-us" target="_blank">English Folk
Dance and Song Society</a> and has been reproduced by kind permission of
the Society.</p>

<p>In summer we perform at venues in and around Windsor and further
afield at festivals, and as guests of other Morris sides. Check out our
<a href="/">programme</a> for more details.</p>
<p>We are easily spotted in our sparkling white kit, with splashes of
green, red and yellow on our rosettes and ribbons providing a colourful
contrast. Watch out for our ‘Fools’, who act as our MCs and can give us
a noisy whack with the bladder if we step out of line - Cherry, with the
Round Tower hat, and Sally, given to punning limericks.</p>
<p>We are often asked how we keep our kit sparkling white. Quite easy
really - we avoid messy food, children and dogs, and don’t sit down all
day!</p>
<p>We <a href="/course/">run a ‘taster’ course</a> every Autumn at which
<strong>you too</strong> can learn to dance.</p>
