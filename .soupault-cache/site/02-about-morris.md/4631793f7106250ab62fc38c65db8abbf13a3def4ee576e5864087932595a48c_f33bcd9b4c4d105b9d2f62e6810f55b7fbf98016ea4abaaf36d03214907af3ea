<p>In 1600, Shakespearean actor <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kempe">Will Kempe</a> danced
from London to Norwich in what he later called his <em>Nine Daies
Wonder.</em></p>
<p>The earliest evidence of morris dancing dates from the 15th century,
when royal courts and wealthy households throughout Europe were paying
for ‘Morys’, ‘Morisk’, ‘Moresca’ or similarly named dancers – these were
highly-paid professionals providing high-status entertainment. You might
hear of morris dancing being a survival of pagan fertility rites, but
this appears to be just a romantic myth.</p>
<p>The morris dances you see these days owe their origins to the late
nineteenth century. At this time there was a big upsurge in interest in
folk customs and there were people with the time and money to collect
music and dance. The term morris dancing covers a number of forms
including those with clogs, bells, hankies, sticks, swords and disguised
faces. What links all these styles is that the dances are done for
show.</p>
<p>Morris groups are all amateurs now. Like any street entertainment, we
hope you will enjoy our performance and tokens of appreciation from you
in the form of coins (or notes!) of the realm are welcome. Look out for
our collecting tin and its decoration.</p>
