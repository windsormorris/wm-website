We're not all born Morris dancers! Few Morris dancers come from a Morris dancing 
background; we tried it and loved it, and you can have a go too.

Every year in the autumn, we run evening taster sessions so you too can come along and find out what it's all about.

You can find us at the [Gardeners Hall, St Leonards Rd, Windsor, SL4 3DR](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Gardeners+Hall/@51.470932,-0.620298,16z)

<a href='wm_contact.html'>Contact us</a> for further details or if you would like to come along.

Although membership of Windsor Morris is by invitation only, 
<b>everyone is welcome</b> to join us at these sessions.
