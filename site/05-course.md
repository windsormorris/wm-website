Try for yourself!
=================

We're not all born Morris dancers! Few Morris dancers come from a Morris dancing 
background; we tried it and loved it, and you can have a go too.

Every year in the autumn, we run three, free, weekly taster sessions (every Wednesday evening) so you too can come along and find out what it's all about.

The first session will be on **Wednesday 10th September 2025 from 8pm**.  Do please come along, enjoy yourself and see what all the fuss is about!

You can find us at the [Gardeners Hall, St Leonards Rd, Windsor, SL4 3DR](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Gardeners+Hall/@51.470932,-0.620298,16z).

[Contact us](/contact-us/) for further details or just turn up!

Although membership of Windsor Morris is by invitation only, 
<b>everyone is welcome</b> to join us at these sessions.
