Try for yourself!
=================

We're not all born Morris dancers! Few Morris dancers come from a Morris dancing 
background; we tried it and loved it, and you can have a go too.

Every year in the autumn, we run three, free, weekly taster sessions on Wednesday evenings, so you too can come along and find out what it's all about.  There is no obligation on either side!

The next session will be in **September 2026**.  Check back nearer the time for full details or [contact us](/contact-us/) and we'll remind you again in August.
