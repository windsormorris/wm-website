We are a friendly, energetic and enthusiastic group who enjoy dancing together and taking our dances to a variety of audiences. 

We perform in public between May and September, but practice throughout the year, and [run a 'taster' course](course/) every Autumn at which **you too** can learn to Morris dance. 

The next session will be on **Wednesday 25th October from 8pm** at the [Gardeners Hall, St Leonards Rd, Windsor, SL4 3DR](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Gardeners+Hall/@51.470932,-0.620298,16z).
